Translating research into policy involves working in a few different fields. Much of my work so far has involved non-profit and NGO organizations, government agencies, and universities. Ultimately, I believe translating research into policy means creating a well-informed public. If government is to represent the will of the people, creating research-based policies must mean creating a well-informed public. My aim is to take research out of elite hands and make it accessible to the public and policymakers.
