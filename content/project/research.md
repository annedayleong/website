My research focuses primarily on policies impacting children and families, with a particular focus on policies in early childhood. Early childhood generally means pregnancy to five years old. In the United States, some of those early childhood policies include topics such as preschool education, childcare, family violence, and maternity leave. Internationally, the policies Iâ€™ve focused on include topics such as refugee children, stateless families, human trafficking, and child protections.
